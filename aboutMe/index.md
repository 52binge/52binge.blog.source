**友情觀：**

> Whatever you do in this life, it's not legendary, unless your friends are there to see it.

**人生觀：**

> Life is full of changes. One day you have an apartment, the next day it's a house of dumplings. But the important stuff doesn't change. To the important stuff.

**愛情觀：**


> When you're single, and your friends start to get married, every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation: "Will you be bringing a guest, or will you be attending alone?"
