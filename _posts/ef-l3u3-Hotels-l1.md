The Dalton Hotel is great. It's right downtown, and you can walk to the river. The rooms are really comfortable  and have free wireless internet. Everything is modern and clean. Oh, yeah – there's a great swimming pool and  fitness  club, too. I think the rates are reasonable. It's about 300 a night.

My favorite hotel is The Pines. It's in the forest. Everything is green and beautiful. It's also close to downtown, about 20 minutes by taxi. The rooms are not modern, but they are very comfortable. The rates are reasonable, about $100 a night. Oh, and the food in the restaurant is delicious.
