------- | -------
[SALLY] Hey, Harry. Did you see the story about Apex Corporation? |
[HARRY] No. |
[SALLY] There was a robbery there last Friday night. |
[HARRY] Really? |
[SALLY] Yeah. One of the thieves came in through a window, then he opened the door for the others. |
[SALLY] They stole all the computers in the office, and some money. The staff arrived the next day to find everything gone. |
[HARRY] That’s a bit scary. Apex Corporation is just three blocks from us. |
[SALLY] Yeah. There’s too much crime in this neighborhood. |
[HARRY] Oh, it’s the economy. No one has any money right now. |
[SALLY] Hey. I heard that Todd asked Joan two months ago about hiring a security guard, but Joan said no. A guard was too expensive. |
[HARRY] Let me guess: We’re hiring a guard now. |
[SALLY] Yep. She starts tomorrow. |
[HARRY] She? A female guard? |
[SALLY] Uh-huh. |

Jenny,

I'm visiting a friend in New Orleans. It's a beautiful city. I love the buildings and the people. I'm having a good time, but a thief broke into my friend's apartment and stole $130! That's a lot of money. We called the police, and they are looking for the thief. I'm going home to Springdale tomorrow, and that's OK with me. I'm really upset about the theft.
