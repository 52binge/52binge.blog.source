[SALLY] Hey, Todd, what’s all this? |
[TODD] I’m planning a trip with my family. I want something big this year, something really special for the kids. |
[SALLY] Where are you **thinking of going**? |
[TODD] It’s **down to** two options: Patagonia, or Kenya. |
[SALLY] Wow! Cool! |
[TODD] Yeah. Both places have amazing animals. My kids are crazy about animals. |
[TODD] You see, they’ve been to the zoo, but I want them to see animals in the wild. |
[SALLY] Yeah. |
[TODD] So, it’s down to whales, penguins and seals in Patagonia; or, zebras, lions and elephants in Kenya. I feel like a child, too, planning this trip. |
[SALLY] Maybe **I should go on a trip**. Where did you get these brochures?  [bro'ʃʊr] |

## 3. Reading

Of all animals, the cheetah is the fastest runner. Cheetahs can run faster than 95 kilometers an hour. (The slowest animal is the sloth. It moves slower than one kilometer per hour.) Cheetahs have very large eyes, but maybe the most interesting thing about cheetahs is their colors. Their black and yellow colors are perhaps the most gorgeous of any animal. Their fur looks just like the African wilderness, so it's difficult to see them. It's unlikely that you'll ever visit the beautiful cheetah in the wilderness of Africa, or the Middle East. The easiest way to see a cheetah is to come here. Today, 10 amazing cheetahs are living with us at Adventure Park.
