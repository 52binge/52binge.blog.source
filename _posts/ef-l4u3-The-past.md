[SALLY] Hey, Harry. Did you see the story about Apex Corporation? |
[HARRY] No. |
[SALLY] There was a robbery there last Friday night. |
[HARRY] Really? |
[SALLY] Yeah. One of the thieves came in through a window, then he opened the door for the others. |
[SALLY] They stole all the computers in the office, and some money. The staff arrived the next day to find everything gone. |
[HARRY] That’s a bit scary. Apex Corporation is just three blocks from us. |
[SALLY] Yeah. There’s too much crime in this neighborhood. |
[HARRY] Oh, it’s the economy. No one has any money right now. |

That's a lot of money. We called the police, and they are looking for the thief. I'm going home to Springdale tomorrow, and that's OK with me. I'm really upset about the theft.

[SALLY] You guys are going to love Yosemite National Park. |
[SIMON] I can’t wait. |
[SALLY] We’re going to hike on a special trail. Very few people know about it. |
[SIMON] Sounds good. |
[SALLY] You feel so close to nature there. Especially when you see a deer, or a bear. |
[JAKE] Did you say, bear? |
[SALLY] Yeah. There are black bears in Yosemite. They’re really beautiful. And big. |
[SIMON] Oh. |
[SALLY] Actually, I have an interesting story about a bear. Last time I camped in Yosemite, we had a problem with one. |
[JAKE] A problem? With a bear? |
[SALLY] Uh-huh. |
[JAKE] I don’t think I’m going to like this story. |
[SALLY] It was really late at night. We were asleep. Then, we heard a noise outside the tent. |
[SIMON] Go on. |
[SALLY] We left the tent, and outside we saw a huge bear. |
[SIMON] What did you do? |
[SALLY] Oh, nothing. |
[SALLY] We just, uh, watched him, and he watched us. And then he tore open our backpacks, and sat down, and slowly ate all our food. |
[SIMON] Then what happened? |
[SALLY] Finally, he just walked away. He didn’t even look at us, as he went back into the trees. |
[JAKE] And we’re going to the same place? |
[SALLY] Don’t worry, Jake. It’s very safe. |
