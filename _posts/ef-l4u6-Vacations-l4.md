Hi, Nicole!

How are you? I'm going to stay another night in Mali so that I can relax and do more sightseeing. Today, I'll take a tour  of Djenne to see the amazing old buildings. The downtown market is full of wonderful smells, so I'm eating a lot of good food. I hope my money lasts because I'm buying many beautiful clothes. I'll give  some to you!   

Love,

Megan
