[IAN] Let me introduce you to ... Kevin. |
[IAN] Student. |
[IAN] Popular with the ladies. |
[IAN] So, tell our **viewers**, why are you studying **bioengineering**? |
[KEVIN] Well, I've always liked it, so **that's why I decided to study bioengineering**. |
[IAN] What are you reading ? |
[IAN] I know the movies ... So tell our viewers ... |
[IAN] What did you think about the movies? |
[KEVIN] Well, I hated the last one. |
[KEVIN] The book is good, but the movie is like an action movie. It's terrible. |
[KEVIN] The first one is the best. |
[KEVIN] It's even **a bit scary**. |
[IAN] So it's a horror movie. |
[KEVIN] No, I feel it's not really a horror movie. |
[KEVIN] I think it's more of a thriller. ['θrɪlə] |
[IAN] So no happy ending. |
[IAN] And `what do we have here?` |
[IAN] No girls, no life, and he's an Econ major. |
[FELTON] No hobbies? |

[IAN] Wow, that's really interesting, Felton ... the Third. |
[FELTON] I also like movies, especially the soundtrack. |

------- | -------|
JENNY: I just saw another Joseph Fiennes movie. |
LUCAS: Which one  ? Is it an action movie? |
JENNY: Uh, 'Shakespeare in Love.' It's a romantic comedy. But **I think that there's some good history in it**, too. It's funny because Shakespeare can't think of any good ideas. I thought it was quite entertaining. |
LUCAS: Me, too. I don't usually like romances, but **that's one of my favorite movies. It's an old one.** |
JENNY: Yeah, it's quite old, but it's still good. |
LUCAS: Mm-hmm. Did you watch it with your kids? |
JENNY: No, but **I think I could show this one to my kids.** |

> I thought that they did a fantastic job.
