John looks like one of those little people in 'Lord of the Rings,' with funny ears. He always has a smile in his eyes. He also tells crazy stories. He has one story about playing the flute in New Orleans. He was playing on the street when a river of water came down the street. He ran! In the end, both John and I got hired by BTC. Now he's an old friend.
