## Writing

Dear Hotel Argent,

My wife and I would like to reserve a double, nonsmoking room in August. We'd like to check in on the 14th and check out on the 19th. That's five nights. We'd like a room with wireless internet and a big bathroom. We'd also like a reasonable rate.

Thank you very much.

Jim Daniels
