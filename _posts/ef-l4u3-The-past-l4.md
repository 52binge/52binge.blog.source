------- | -------
[SALLY] You guys are going to love Yosemite National Park. |
[SIMON] I can’t wait. |
[SALLY] We’re going to hike on a special trail. Very few people know about it. |
[SIMON] Sounds good. |
[SALLY] You feel so close to nature there. Especially when you see a deer, or a bear. |
[JAKE] Did you say, bear? |
[SALLY] Yeah. There are black bears in Yosemite. They’re really beautiful. And big. |
[SIMON] Oh. |
[SALLY] Actually, I have an interesting story about a bear. Last time I camped in Yosemite, we had a problem with one. |
[JAKE] A problem? With a bear? |
[SALLY] Uh-huh. |
[JAKE] I don’t think I’m going to like this story. |
[SALLY] It was really late at night. We were asleep. Then, we heard a noise outside the tent. |
[SIMON] Go on. |
[SALLY] We left the tent, and outside we saw a huge bear. |
[SIMON] What did you do? |
[SALLY] Oh, nothing. |
[SALLY] We just, uh, watched him, and he watched us. And then he tore open our backpacks, and sat down, and slowly ate all our food. |
[SIMON] Then what happened? |
[SALLY] Finally, he just walked away. He didn’t even look at us, as he went back into the trees. |
[JAKE] And we’re going to the same place? |
[SALLY] Don’t worry, Jake. It’s very safe. |
