HAYLEY: So, I just went shopping, and there were just too many amazing clothes. In the first shop, I found this classic pair of jeans  . They are so cute. I also tried on a skirt, but it was too loose  . Then, at the second place, I tried some interesting jeans, but I decided they were way too baggy  . But I did find a skirt that is pretty, and tight. It looks great. Then, I couldn't believe it: I also went to a hat store and bought this very stylish hat. Funny, because there were some hats there that were, like, totally out of  style. At the last shop, I tried on two dresses. One is very formal  , and the other one, here – it's pretty casual. What do you think?
