## 1. Evaluating a Hypothesis

Once we have done some trouble shooting for errors in our predictions by:

- Getting more training examples
- Trying smaller sets of features
- Trying additional features
- Trying polynomial features
- Increasing or decreasing $Î»$

We can move on to evaluate our new hypothesis.

A hypothesis may have a low error for the training examples but still be inaccurate (because of overfitting). Thus, to evaluate a hypothesis, given a dataset of training examples, we can split up the data into two sets: a training set and a test set. Typically, the training set consists of 70% of your data and the test set is the remaining 30%.

The new procedure using these two sets is then:

1. Learn $\Theta$ and minimize $J_{train}(\Theta)$ using the training set
2. Compute the test set error $J\_{test}(\Theta)$

### The test set error

1. For linear regression: $J\_{test}(\Theta) = \dfrac{1}{2m\_{test}} \sum\_{i=1}^{m\_{test}}(h\_\Theta(x^{(i)}\_{test}) - y^{(i)}\_{test})^2$
2. For classification ~ Misclassification error (aka 0/1 misclassification error):

$$
err(h\_\Theta(x),y) = \begin{matrix} 1 & \mbox{if } h\_\Theta(x) \geq 0.5\ and\ y = 0\ or\ h\_\Theta(x) < 0.5\ and\ y = 1\newline 0 & \mbox otherwise \end{matrix}
$$

This gives us a binary 0 or 1 error result based on a misclassification. The average test error for the test set is:

$$
\text{Test Error} = \dfrac{1}{m\_{test}} \sum^{m\_{test}}\_{i=1} err(h\_\Theta(x^{(i)}\_{test}), y^{(i)}\_{test})
$$

This gives us the proportion of the test data that was misclassified.
