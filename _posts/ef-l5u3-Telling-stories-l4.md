[SIMON] No. What about it? |
[JAKE] It ended in disaster. |
[SIMON] What happened? |
[JAKE] One night, I had a really big delivery, like, 20 pizzas. They were on the back of the motorcycle. |
[JAKE] I was driving down the road, and I was in a hurry, and then this dog ran out in front of me. |

[JAKE] There were pizzas all over the street, and I ended up on the sidewalk. |
[SIMON] Ouch ! |
