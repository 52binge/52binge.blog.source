## 3. Reading

I feel terrible. I didn't sleep last night because I had a bad fever  . I was just too hot! I have a bad cough  , too – maybe because I smoke? My colleagues always complain about the noise I make, but I can't answer them because I have a sore throat  and I can't speak. I didn't eat all day because I felt nauseous  and I had a stomachache  , and every time I wanted to stand up, I couldn't because I was so dizzy.

- I have been feeling very bad `for` the last two days.
- I have been having problems sleeping.
- Have you been experiencing any other problems?
