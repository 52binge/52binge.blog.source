**Restaurant review**

`Serene Grill`

by Carey Smith

Serene Grill is a great choice for dinner. Their specialty is steak, but they serve many other excellent entrees like roasted chicken and `grilled salmon`. My favorite is the salmon. There is also a great selection of `appetizers`. The `shrimp cocktail` is very popular, and the restaurant is famous for its fresh oysters. The desserts are delicious and authentic. You can choose from apple pie with vanilla ice cream to chocolate cake with fresh strawberries. Prices are reasonable, and the servers are friendly. Outdoor seating is available in the summer, and parking is free before 9 p.m.

**Writing**

The Great Wall is my favorite restaurant. They serve authentic Chinese food. They have many different appetizer and entrees. the spicy beef entree is delicious.most entrees are between $10 and $15. The restaurant is very busy on the weekends, so make a reservation. The restaurant is noisy, but all the servers are friendly and everybody has fun.Desserts are not their specialty.
