------- | -------|
[IAN] I don't agree with Kevin. |

[IAN] I think movies are more fun. |
[IAN] Some actors are amazing. |
[IAN] They don't have to be famous. |

[KEVIN] Ian likes westerns. |
[KEVIN] Some westerns are dreadful. |
[KEVIN] The plot and the setting are always the same. |
[KEVIN] The characters are too simple: a good guy and a bad guy. |
[KEVIN] First, there's a town. |
[KEVIN] Everybody's happy there. |
[KEVIN] Then, the bad guys arrive, and the people aren't happy anymore. |
[KEVIN] And next, a new sheriff comes to town to help these poor people. | 
[KEVIN] And finally, there is a fight in the middle of the town between the new sheriff and the bad people. |
[KEVIN] Guess who wins? |
[KEVIN] It's so simple, you know - a good guy and a bad guy, good against evil, saving a girl, always a happy ending. |

------- | -------|
TIM: Wow. Amazing. 'Shaun of the Dead.' I can't believe that movie was made with so little money. |
MEGAN: Oh? How much money did they spend  ? |
TIM: $6.1 million. It seemed like it was created for $50 million. |
MEGAN: But $6.1 million is a lot of money! |
TIM: Not really. Most Hollywood films cost, like, $100 million, or more. |
MEGAN: Huh. How did they do it? |
TIM: Well, it was directed by Edgar Wright. He's brilliant. |
MEGAN: Yeah? |
TIM: He said they weren't given much money, and they were told  to spend it carefully. So he was really careful and worked really hard. |

## 3. Reading & Writing

**Moneyball**

I don't like baseball, but 'Moneyball' was a very interesting movie. The story is a little dark. You learn some dreadful things about sports, but 'Moneyball' has a happy ending. 'Moneyball' is about the Oakland A's general manager, the famous Billy Beane. Beane wasn't given much money. He had to get creative. Billy Beane was played by Brad Pitt, and 'Moneyball' was directed by Bennett Miller. I think that actors always do a good job when they work with Bennett Miller.


I just saw 'Rear Window'. What an amazing movie! 'Rear Window' was made in 1954 and was directed by the famous Alfred Hitchcock. 'Rear Window' is a dark story, like most Hitchcock movies. L.B. is played by James Stewart. L.B. is a photographer, but his leg is broken. He has to stay home, so he watches his neighbors through their windows. I felt sorry for his poor neighbors!
