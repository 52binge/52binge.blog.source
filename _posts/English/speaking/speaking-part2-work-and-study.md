the first day back at work after the holidays

I'm a data program engineer, I have **`daily meetings`** to discuss new products, **`in addition to that`** I produce tables and write codes. **`Also`**, I do financial data collection, calculation, analysis and processing and other related development work, including but not limited to data related to foreign exchange transactions.

My job is not difficult, **`one reason is`** that I produce tables by writing many similar codes, the tasks are often very **`repetitive`**, **`because`** the data analysis process is similar, there are a lot of tools that can help me to complete it.
