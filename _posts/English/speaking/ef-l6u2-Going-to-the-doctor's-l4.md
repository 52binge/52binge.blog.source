## 4. Reading

I guess the strangest accident I have ever had was when I was at school. I was playing a game where you had to lie on the ground, and all the others jumped on top of you. It was fine until the biggest kid in school came and jumped on top, too! I broke my finger, `bruised my ribs` and `sprained` my wrist. I spent the night in the hospital, and it took me a couple of months to get better.

## 5. Writing

I had an accident last winter when I was arriving at work. I was coming into the building, climbing the steps, when I slipped on the icy floor. I fell down the steps and `broke my ankle`. I also `sprained my left wrist and bruised my back badly`. I had to go to the hospital, and I stayed there for three days. I hurt a lot! I had to stay at home for two more weeks before I could go back to work.
