We live in a modern and fashionable era [ˈɪərə]. In our life we used many things which <span style="background-color: rgb(196, 237, 157);">look very stylish[stylish] and breakable </span> such as glass material, showpieces(n. (供展示用的)样品; ) etc. <span style="background-color: rgb(196, 237, 157);">Here I would like to talk about “Microwave oven”</span>. 3 months ago on my mother’s birthday, we threw a party at home for our near and dear ones.

I planned to bake a special cake for my mother So that I worked on it. Firstly, I helped my mother with **cleaning and dusting**. While doing cleaning accidentally “Microwave oven” fell down and the main plate of the oven which is made of glass broken.

I felt very sad at that moment because without glass plate it is not possible to do baking in the oven. On that time, my all planning which I made for my mother’s happiness also suffered. My heart was beating fast, and I do not understand what to do now. Then I tried another oven’s glass plate, but it makes my day bad to worse. While using another glass plate, oven electrical wire got short-circuited. Everything was going wrong then with strong heart I told all things to my mother. She said to me be relaxed and calmed.

After that, we ordered a cake and celebrate my mother’s birthday. Next day, I went to an electrician shop to repair my oven. Fortunately, it was in warranty till so store manager replace my oven with a new one, but he charges some amount for a glass plate. On the end, I learned a lesson electronically thing needs extra care and safety also.
