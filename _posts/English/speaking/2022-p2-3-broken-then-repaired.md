### 1.1. When it happened

Being a big-time food fanatic, I love tasting mouth-watering delicacies. As far as desserts are concerned, I am into cake. 
Although I have tasted cake many times, the one I had a deep memory during my last birthday was special, **and I enjoyed that the most**.

> big-time 顶级的

> fanatic  [fəˈnætɪk]

### 1.2. Where it happened

During my last birthday, the world was going through the second wave of the covid-19. Due to that, my city was in a state of lockdown. There is no doubt that a birthday party is incomplete without cake. So on my birthday, my friends baked a cake for me at our home. As going out was not an option for us. So, my mother made the cake by using the ingredients  [ɪnˈgriːdiənts]  available at home.

### 1.3. Who you got the cake from

First, she baked the bread, and for that, she used whole wheat flour. For the icing on the cake, she made whipped cream from milk. And she further garnished the cake with Choco chips and fruits. I liked the cake because my friends baked it out of love and affection for me. Despite being newbies at cooking, they did tremendous hard work, and after watching umpteen videos on YouTube, they baked a mouth-watering cake for me.

> this is the best cake I have ever taste in  my life rather say this is the best cake I have ever tasted in my life 

### 1.4. And explain why it’s a special cake

As it was her first attempt, I was apprehensive regarding the taste of the cake. However, to my surprise, it was far beyond my expectation. And the smile my friends had on their faces after getting accolades from me would always remain etched in my memories. In totality, that is the best cake I have ever tasted in my life.


## 2. something broken in your home and then repaired (Microwave oven [ˈʌvn] )

You should say:

- What it is
- How it was broken
- How you got it repaired
- And how you felt about it 

## 2.1 What it is

We live in a modern and fashionable era [ˈɪərə]. In our life we used many things which look very stylish and breakable(时尚易碎) such as glass material, showpieces(n. (供展示用的)样品; ) etc. Here I would like to talk about “Microwave oven”. Last month on my mother’s birthday, we arranged a get-together at home for our `near and dear ones` 亲朋好友. 

## 2.2 How it was broken

I planned to bake a special cake for my mother So that I worked on it. Firstly, I helped my mother with **cleaning and dusting**. While doing cleaning accidentally “Microwave oven” fell down and the main plate of the oven which is made of glass broken.

I felt very sad at that moment because without glass plate it is not possible to do baking in the oven. On that time, my all planning which I made for my mother’s happiness also suffered. My heart was beating fast, and I do not understand what to do now. Then I tried another oven’s glass plate, but it makes my day bad to worse. While using another glass plate, oven electrical wire got short-circuited. Everything was going wrong then with strong heart I told all things to my mother. She said to me be relaxed and calmed.

## 2.3 How you got it repaired

After that, we ordered a cake and celebrate my mother’s birthday. Next day, I went to an electrician shop to repair my oven. Fortunately, it was in warranty till so store manager replace my oven with a new one, but he charges some amount for a glass plate. On the end, 

I learned a lesson electronically thing needs extra care and safety also.
