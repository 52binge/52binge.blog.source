Food provides nutrients, Energy for activity, growth, and all physical functions such asbreathing, digestion of food, and 40, heat retention. In this busy life, people don’t have much time to prepare meals at home. It also happened to me, so I had usually eaten some street food after office, which led to some health problems last year. So I bought a microwave.

Before buying it, sometimes I think about how i lived/ managed my life. A few months ago, whenever I ate out, I spent a lot of money on food and then on medicine to cure the health problems caused by street food.

Now I can say I am saving a lot of money because I eat healthy homemade food.
