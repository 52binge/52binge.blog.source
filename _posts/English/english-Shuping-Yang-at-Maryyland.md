## Speech Full Text

> **Good afternoon faculty, students, parents and friends.**

> I am truly honored and grateful to speak at the commencement for the University of Maryland, Class of 2017. 
> 
>  
> People often ask me: Why did you come to the University of Maryland?
> I always answer: Fresh air.
> 
>  
> Five years ago, as I step off the plane from China, and left the terminal at Dallas Airport. I was ready to put on one of my five face masks, but when I took my first breath of American air. I put my mask away. 
> 
>  
> The air was so sweet and fresh, and utterly luxurious.
> 
>  
> I was surprised by this. I grew up in a city in China, where I had to wear a face mask every time I went outside, otherwise, I might get sick.
> 
>  
> However, the moment Iinhaled and exhaled outside the airport，I felt free.
> 
>  
> No more fog on my glasses, no more difficult breathing, no more suppression.
> 
>  
> Every breath was a delight. As I stand here today, I cannot help, but recall that feeling of freedom. 
> 

&nbsp;

> At the University of Maryland, I will soon feel another kind of fresh air for which I will beforever grateful — the fresh air of free speech.
> 
>
> Before I came to the UnitedStates, I learned in history class about the Declaration of Independence, butthese words had no meaning to me— Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness.
> 
>  
> I was merely memorizing the words to get good grades.
> 
>   
> These words sounded so strange, so abstract and foreign to me, until I came to University of Maryland.
> 
>  
> I have learned the right to freely express oneself is sacred in American.
> 
>  
> Each day in Maryland, I was encouraged to express my opinions on controversial issues. 
> 
>  
> I could challenge astatement made by my instructor. I could even rate my professors online.
> 
>  
> But nothing prepared me forthe culture shock I experienced when I watched a university production of the play— Twilight: Los Angeles.
> 
> Twilight is a play by AnnaDeavere Smith about the 1992 Los Angeles Riots.
>  
> 
> The riots followed acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers in the videotaped arrest and beating of Rodney King.
>  
> 
> For six days, the city was in chaos as citizens took to the streets.
>  
> 
> In Twilight, the student actors were openly talking about racism, sexism and politics.
>  
> 
> I was shocked, I never thought such topic could be discussed openly.
>  
> 
> The play was my first taste of political story telling, one that makes the audience think critically. 
>  
> 
> I have always had a burning desire to tell these kinds of stories, but I was convinced that only authorities on the narrative, only authorities could define the truth. 
>  
> 
> However, the opportunity toimmerse myself in the perse community at the University of Maryland exposed me to various, many different perspectives on truth.
>  
> 
> I soon realized that here I have the opportunity to speak freely. 
>  
> 
> My voice matters. 
>  
> 
> Your voice matters.
>  
> 
> Our voices matter.
>  
> 
> Civil engagement is not at ask just for politicians. I have witnessed this when I saw my fellow student smarching in Washington DC, voting in the presidential election and raising money to support various causes.
>  
> 
> I have seen that everyone has a right to participate and advocate for change.
>  
> 
> I used to believe that one inpidual participation could not make a difference, but here we are, United Terps.
>  
> 
> Together, we can push our society to be more just, open and peaceful.

> 
> Class of 2017, we are graduating from a university that embraces a liberal arts education that nurtures us to think critically, and also to care and feel for humanity. 
>  
> 
> We are equipped with the knowledge of various disciplines and we are ready to face  the challenges of our society.
>  
> 
> Some of us may go to graduate school, some us may step into professions and some of us may begin ajourney of exploration.
>  
> 
> But no matter what we do,remember, democracy and free speech should not be taken for granted.
>  
> 
> Democracy and freedom are the fresh air that is worth fighting for.
>  
> 
> Freedom is oxygen. Freedomis passion. Freedom is love.
>  
> 
> And as a French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre once said: freedom is a choice, our future is dependent on the choices we make today and tomorrow.
>  
> 
> We are all playwrights of the next chapters of our lives. Together, we write the human history.
>  
>
