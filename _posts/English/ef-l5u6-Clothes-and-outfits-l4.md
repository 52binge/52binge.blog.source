## 3. Writing

Most of my clothes are way too expensive. I'd rather wear cool brands from a small shop than a cheap, polyester thing from a department store. I prefer silk and wool to cotton and leather. I like wearing red, yellow and orange more than dark, boring colors. I just bought a fantastic, new, orange, Spanish, leather handbag. I absolutely love it!
