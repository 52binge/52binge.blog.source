## 2. Body paragraph 1

> online shopping is harmful to the environment

On the one hand, e-shopping has a negative influence on the environment. Unlike in-store shopping, in which customers make purchases after trying and checking the products, online consumers shop in front of the screen. With a few mouse clicks, their orders are easily placed based on the pictures, descriptions and <span style="background-color: rgb(196, 237, 157);">comments provided</span> on the website. However, misleading as these information can be, the commodities received do not always meet the expectations of the buyers. To make the clients content, the convenient exchange and return procedure is then initiated, which requires extra packages to be consumed and more truck trips to be made to pick up the products. This increases not only the amount of waste but also the emission of the hazardous substance in the air. Thus, online shopping can be harmful to the environment.
