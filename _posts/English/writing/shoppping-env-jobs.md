## 1. Introduction

harmful to the environment but benefits the job market

It is true that online shopping has become more and more popular in our time. In my opinion, while this trend is not <span style="background-color: rgb(196, 237, 157);">eco-friendly</span>, it helps to create new job opportunities.

> It is true that...has become more and more popular in our time

## 2. Body 1 - harmful to the env

> online shopping is harmful to the environment

<span style="background-color: rgb(196, 237, 157);">On the one hand</span>, e-shopping has a negative influence on the environment. Unlike in-store shopping, in which customers make purchases after trying and checking the products, online consumers shop in front of the screen. With a few mouse clicks, their orders are easily placed based on the pictures, descriptions and <span style="background-color: rgb(196, 237, 157);">comments provided</span> on the website. 

However, misleading as these information can be, the `commodities`=goods received do not always meet the expectations of the buyers. To make the clients content, the convenient exchange and return procedure is then `initiated`, which requires extra packages to be consumed and more truck trips to be made to pick up the products. This increases <span style="background-color: rgb(196, 237, 157);">not only</span> the amount of waste <span style="background-color: rgb(196, 237, 157);">but also</span> the <span style="background-color: rgb(196, 237, 157);">emission of the hazardous substance</span> in the air. Thus, online shopping can be harmful to the environment.

> Unlike in-store shopping, <span style="background-color: rgb(196, 237, 157);">in which</span> customers make purchases after trying and checking the products, online consumers shop in front of the screen.
