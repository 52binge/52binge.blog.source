------- | -------
[AGENT] Good afternoon. May I help you? |
[SALLY] Hi. Yeah. I, um, um, I'm thinking about taking a vacation in March. |
[AGENT] **How many of you are there?** |
[SALLY] Two. I’m going with a friend. |
[AGENT] Okay. And, uh, where are you thinking of going? |
[SALLY] We haven’t decided yet. We want a relaxing vacation, definitely a nice beach, some nature, and not too expensive. What would you suggest? |
[AGENT] Well, at that time of year, I’d recommend Hawaii. They have some of the best package tours. |
[SALLY] I’ve always wanted to go to Hawaii. |
[AGENT] I just got this brochure from a hotel in Maui, `right on the ocean`. Great diving just off the beach, lots of coral reefs and mountains not too far away. |
[SALLY] That sounds perfect! Oh! And can we see a volcano? |
[AGENT] That’s actually on another island, but I can arrange a tour. |
[SALLY] Cool. So how much would it all be? |
[AGENT] Well, how many nights would you like to stay? |
[SALLY] Ummm, maybe six? Or seven? |
[AGENT] Okay. Give me a minute, and I can give you some prices. |
