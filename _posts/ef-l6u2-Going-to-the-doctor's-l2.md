A: DOCTOR - B: PAM |
------- | -------
[DOC] How are you feeling? |
[PAM] Not so great. |
[DOC] Hmm. I’m sorry to hear that. How long have you been feeling bad? |
[PAM] Um, since yesterday. But I got really sick in the middle of the night. |
[DOC] Well, you do have a slight fever, but that’s nothing to worry about. And your blood pressure is good. Did you eat anything unusual yesterday? |
[PAM] No, I don’t think so. I had pizza for lunch, and I didn’t eat dinner. |
[DOC] Well, based on the symptoms you’ve described, I think that you have a stomach flu. It’s been going around. |
[PAM] Yeah, that’s what I thought. |
[DOC] I’m going to write you a prescription for medicine to help your stomach and stop the diarrhea. |
[DOC] Stay in bed and, uh, drink plenty of liquids. If you don’t feel better after 24 hours, I want you to call the nurse. |
[DOC] And, uh, when you have an appetite again, take it easy. I’d recommend plain white rice and maybe some yoghurt. |
[PAM] Okay, doctor, thanks |
